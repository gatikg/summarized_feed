# summarized_feed

# pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
# Run App.py 
# click and Open the URL
# Paste Original URL
# Wait for Some Time
# Get the Summarized Text
# See URL Crawling Folder
(Note: [Text1.txt](https://github.com/gatikg/summarized_feed/blob/main/URL%20Crawling/Text1.txt) is the output of url_crawling.py.
url_crawling2.py is the 2nd Approach(Lesser Preferred) and suggest to use url_crawling.py instead)
